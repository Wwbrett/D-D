**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)  
**Components:** V, S, M(ammunition or thrown weapon)  
**Duration:** Instantanious 


You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.
