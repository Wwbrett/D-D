# D&D Tool Kit
### By William Brett
Small project I'm working on to help with my running of dungeons and dragons games. 

The project is availible to everyone by using GitHub's pages.
Simply go to [This Website.] (http://wwbrett.github.io)

The goals of this project:
- [x] To allow DMs to keep track of initiative during encounters
- [x] To allow DMs to keep track of enemy health during encounters
- [ ] To allow players to keep track of their spells, having a list of known and prepared spells
- [ ] To allow players to look up information about spells they have or might want to get
- [x] To allow DMs to keep notes during the game, be it conditions, names of npcs or name of where they're going


As of right now not all of these goals are implemented, and more will be added as I come accross problems that need to be solved.
This is an ongoing project of mine and probably won't end until I'm out of ideas about what to add.

There is a progress bar at the bottom of the site, this shows where in development I am, it's most likely wrong but it's nice to have some kind of visual feedback.
