# D&D Tool Kit
### By William Brett
Small project I'm working on to help with my running of dungeons and dragons games. 

The project is availible to everyone by using GitHub's pages.
Simply go to [This Website.] (wwbrett.github.io)

The goals of this project:
- [x] To allow DMs to keep track of initiative during fights
- [x] To allow DMs to keep track of enemy health during fights
- [ ] To allow players to keep track of their spells
- [ ] To allow DMs to keep simple notes during the game

The website isn't complete, which is why there is a number of buttons that don't do anything as well
as text that is less exposition and more just waffle. The progress bar at the bottom of the site 
shows where I think I am in development.
